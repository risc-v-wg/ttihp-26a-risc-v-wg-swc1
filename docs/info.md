## How it works

This is a RISC-V 32I instruction set compatible CPU that uses QSPI PSRAM/Flash as external memory.
It uses a state machine design for Tiny Tapeout to achieve a compact size.
Features:
- 64-bit Free run counter with interrupt
- QSPI memory interface
- 4-bit GPIO, 3-bit GPO, 6-bit GPI
- 1 interrupt pin
- UART with monitor functions (program read/write, etc.)
Constraints:
- M mode only
- Fence not supported
- Ebreak not tested

## How to test

Connect external QSPI PSRAM and connect the UART to a terminal. Upload the test program from the terminal and execute it to verify operation.

UART monitor command list:
g : goto PC address (executes until Ctrl-c is pressed) : format: g <address>
Ctrl-c : Interrupts all commands. Press Ctrl-c if you get stuck : format: Ctrl-c
w : Writes data to memory : format: w <address> .<data>... Ctrl-c
r : Reads data from memory : format: r <start_address> <end_address>
s : Set breakpoint address: format s <break point address>
  When setting: Specify the address value where you want to break
  When clearing: Specify an odd number for the address (set bit[0] to 1)
l : Set data read breakpoint address: format l <break point address>
  When setting: Specify the address value where you want to break
  When clearing: Specify an odd number for the address (set bit[0] to 1)
m : Set data write breakpoint address: format m <break point address>
  When setting: Specify the address value where you want to break
  When clearing: Specify an odd number for the address (set bit[0] to 1)
j : Display the current PC value: format j
i : Write data to I/O registers, etc. The target changes based on the upper 2 bits of the address
  : format: I <address> <data> .... Ctrl-c
  Upper 2 bits == 2'b11 ; I/O register
  Upper 2 bits == 2'b10 : CSR register
  Upper 2 bits == 2'b00 : Register File
  *However, for CSR and RF, specify an address equal to 4 times the register number
  Example: Address for CSR mstatus (0x300) is 80000c00
  RF x3 Register: 0000 000c
p: Performs data read operations on I/O registers, etc. The upper 16 bits of the address are ignored
  : format: p <start_address> <end_address>
  Upper 2 bits == 2’b11 ; I/O Register
  Upper 2 bits == 2’b10 : CSR Register
  Upper 2 bits == 2’b00 : Register File
  *However, for CSR and RF registers, specify an address equal to 4 times the register number
  Example: CSR mstatus (0x300) address: 80000c00
  RF x3 Register 0000 000c
t : Memory zero-fill
  : format t <start_address> <end_address>

## External hardware

- An external QSPI PSRAM is required.
- UART connection to a terminal is requred for contorlling chip.
